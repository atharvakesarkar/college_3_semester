# file = open("geeks.txt","r")

## this is the append method and this is working on my python ide
# file = open("atharva.txt", "a")  # Open file in append mode
# file.write("siidhi,niyati,om,adityabhau")  # This works fine
# file.close()  # Always close the file after writing

# # Now open the file again in read mode to read its contents
# file = open("atharva.txt", "r")
# print(file.read())


# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print(f"2 x {i} = {2 * i}")
